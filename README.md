# Diffusion-Model
Analyse the data with a diffusion model using a no-pooling approach (i.e., fit the diffusion model to the data of each individual participant separately), rtdists( in R), and trial-wise maximum likelihood estimation. Then, use ANOVA to compare the individual-level parameter estimates between the two groups (i.e., experts versus novices).
